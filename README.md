# VHDL
In this project, we design and implement an embedded system based on the
Xilinx Picoblaze microprocessor, which will at least include a complex peripheral.

**SPECIFICATIONS:**
Medium-complexity application based on the Picoblaze 3 microprocessor.
The real test of the embedded system will be carried out using the Digilent Nexys 4 DDR board,
which contains an XC7A100T-CSG324-1 FPGA, from the Xilinx Artix 7 family.
The development of the project was as follows:

- ### Step 0
Design of the assigned embedded system on paper, including the elaboration of
a flow diagram, the decisions about which functions are going to be
implemented using hardware and which ones will be developed in software
(HW/SW partitioning), and the design of a block diagram of the whole
embedded system.

- ### Step 1
Design and simulation of the embedded system software program in assembler
using Mediatronix pBlazeIDE tool.

- ### Step 2
Simulation of the embedded microprocessor (hardware + software) in Vivado.

- ### Step 3
Design and simulation of the complete basic embedded system based on the
Picoblaze microprocessor (embedded microprocessor with software +
peripherals). It must include the complex peripheral developed in lesson 2.

o If the post-implementation timing simulation is not viable because it takes a lot
of time to execute, students must perform the complete behavioural simulation
and, at least, a short timing simulation to check that the embedded system
appears to work correctly.

- ### Step 4
Board test of the complete basic embedded system based on the Picoblaze
microprocessor (embedded microprocessor with software + peripherals).
